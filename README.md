How-to Docker (with astroML)
============================

This is a minimal Docker tutorial using astroML as an example.  To try
out the examples, Docker is needed.  The Docker Community Edition (CE)
is free and is avliable at the [Docker Website](https://www.docker.com/get-docker).
It supports all the major platforms from Linux (e.g.,
[Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)), to
[Mac OS X](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac), and even
[Windows](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows).
