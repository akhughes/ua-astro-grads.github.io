title: Notes to editors
---

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ua-astro-grads/code-coffee/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for this website in [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files.

If you prefer to work locally, `git clone https://github.com/ua-astro-grads/code-coffee.git` to get a local copy in `code-coffee`. You may need to install Jekyll, if you haven't used it before: `gem install jekyll bundler`. Once that's done, you can preview your site at http://127.0.0.1:4000/ with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

Whenever you commit and push to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
