Rachel Smullen gave a talk on using [OpenACC](https://www.openacc.org), a system of hints for your C, C++, and Fortran code that enables a compiler to move computations to the GPU or other accelerators. She attended the [International High Performance Computing Summer School](http://ihpcss.org) last summer, which covered OpenACC, and was kind enough to share what she learned with all of us.

There are also some slides from IHPCSS by John Urbanic that cover OpenACC in more detail:

  - [Advanced OpenACC](/downloads/2018-19/hpc-and-openacc/OpenACC_Advanced_OpenACC.PDF)
