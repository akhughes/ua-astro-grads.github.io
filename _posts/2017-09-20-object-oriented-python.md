You can find my talk as a Jupyter Notebook located here:

https://github.com/swyatt7/CC_ObjectOriented

It overviews the 4 pillars of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) then provides a basic tutorial on how to implement classes in Python. There is also some astronomical examples followed by some cool OOP aspects in Python.

If you ever have any questions, feel free to email me at swyatt@email.arizona.edu
